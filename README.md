# odin-recipes

Ok this is a recipe website i built for my "The Odin Project" project. i used html 
only and it's not that applealing. i didn't spend as much time as it deserves specially 
on the actual recipe stuff, am not that good of a cook. i didn't even finish some of 
them i just wanted to practice html and am a begginer so no details. i guess i might come 
back and improve on it latter.
